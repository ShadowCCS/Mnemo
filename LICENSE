Monetization: While Mnemo remains completely free and open source with all its core features available to everyone, we plan to offer optional premium services in the future to simplify the setup process and add convenience.

These premium features will include:

Automated AI model configuration, so users can easily get started without needing to manually input API keys or deal with setup.

Access to premium AI models (if available) with no need for individual configuration.

Users who prefer to set up their own AI models can still use Mnemo for free and will need to handle the setup themselves, including managing API keys and updates if the AI companies change them.

The premium features will provide a hassle-free experience and are available for a monthly subscription. However, they are completely optional—you will still be able to access all the features without these services, but it may require more effort to configure and maintain.
